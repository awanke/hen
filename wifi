ok, now things are kind of messy.
# wifi

check with `iwconfig`, and I know wiki is valid in INSPIRON+10.04, but not on VOSTRO+9.10

so I go to sys->admin->hardware and installed the broadcom wireless driver for my VOSTRO

and reboot, but `iwconfig ` still give me nothing about WLan, shit!

then I nothice there were acttually another driver avaiable there, so I tried, and now I get my wireless connection through *eth2* (not Wlan0 as on INSPIRON)

### I use this on VOSTRO when I messed up my connections and firefox failed to fetch pages.

	root@bull:~# /etc/init.d/networking restart

dnsmasq - A lightweight DHCP and caching DNS server.


if you run `ifdown eth2` and see

	eth2 not configured

you can fix this by run `ifconfig eth2 up` first

## dhcp3-server

when I install 9.10 on INSPIRON, the ad-hoc wireless net work I configured on VOSTRO
namely `no-crypt-peter`

all you need to do now in INSPIRON, is just one clike on no-crypt-peter

and the ip of INSPIRON is confiured to 10.1.43.10
well VOSTRO is 10.1.43.1

ssh done

	ssh peter@10.1.43.1

have a `vivion-ad-hoc` on INSPIRON, then I can ping from VOSTRO to INSPIRON as well

## the trick 

is you need to have both machine connected to a same network
one as server and one as client. Say I created a vivion-ad-hoc connection on INSPIRON, then first I need to connect INSPIRON itself to this vivion-ad-hoc, then I switch to VOSTRO, I can find the vivion-ad-hoc, by click thetray icon, and then click to connect, the ip is got, and the connection is done. no "dhcpclient eth2" is needed.

because for the time being the INSPIRON machine is still fresh and no dhcp3-server is installed
so maybe dnsmasq is used here to be the DHCP server.
