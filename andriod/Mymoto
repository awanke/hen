## uninstall software

    setup->application->manage application 

## reflashing your OS

reboot while holding camera key, then I see:

    USB, fastboot V0.5
    
        verbose boot
        sys recovery

I choose, "sys recovery" by clicking "volume down" button, and now I see three options:

    reboot your sys
    apply sdcard:update.zip
    wip data/factory reset

this means I can do quick root, like this

But, two things worried me:
1.  am I a "Current JF ROM Users" ?
2.  when I unzip JF's US G1 Cupcake 1.51 ROM, I see a whole new system in it
    there are things I really want like(shell...), but everything is different from the original os on 
    my phone(including the mount point of SDcard...)

MotoOS problems:
1.  force me to use all kinds of stupid apps, e.g. motoBlur...
2.  there is nothing in System/app or bin or xbin/, this means there is no sh available

## I need to study

## nasty bootloader

    Unlike the DROID, the Milestone has a bootloader that only allows signed
    Firmware to load. This prevents users from booting Custom ROM images not
    signed by Motorola

Moto has long been notorious by closing open source. What did noto do to my me501

I have seen the "security on... fast boot disabled" on my phone, nightmare
