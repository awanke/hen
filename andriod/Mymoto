## reflashing your OS

reboot while holding camera key, then I see:

    USB, fastboot V0.5
    
        verbose boot
        sys recovery

I choose, "sys recovery" by clicking "volume down" button, and now I see three options:

    reboot your sys
    apply sdcard:update.zip
    wip data/factory reset

this means I can do quick root, like this

But, two things worried me:
1.  am I a "Current JF ROM Users" ?
2.  when I unzip JF's US G1 Cupcake 1.51 ROM, I see a whole new system in it
    there are things I really want like(shell...), but everything is different from the original os on 
    my phone(including the mount point of SDcard...)

MotoOS problems:
1.  force me to use all kinds of stupid apps, motoBlur...
2.  there is nothing in System/app or bin or xbin/, this means there is no sh available
