when you click action->Render as docbook. the below file is executed
{{{
pet@pet-desktop:~/moin-1.8.5/MoinMoin/formatter$ pwd
/home/pet/moin-1.8.5/MoinMoin/formatter
pet@pet-desktop:~/moin-1.8.5/MoinMoin/formatter$ text_docbook.py
}}}

Maybe I can write my own wiki/docbook convertor modifying the above file
and wirite another index generator, then every thing in kdocs/
is clear structured and beautiful.
