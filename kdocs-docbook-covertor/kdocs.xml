I want to start this by recalling the how stupid I was to backup my documentation and notes.
Two years ago, I used a blog to backup my data, it got messy while more and more articles is added, and it was basiclly impossible to do changes, since there is no revision control.
later, I tried google doc for a while and it is nice.
now I use github and I like it so much.
But finally I decide only to keep the unstable stuff in github, and everything
I consider is not to be changed much will be do as docbook files, such like project Tinylion.
