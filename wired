in YANTAI my wired connection is pppoe

now my pppoe is running well, I must wirte down the current look of my system

1.	the tray icon of NetworkManager shows wired connection disconnected
2.	ifconfig eth0 has no ip
3.	dhclient eth0---will fail
4.	somethimes you see "wired connection not managed"
	this does not matter, try NOT to change `/etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf`
	even though it will get rid of the "not managed", but actually when you run `ppoeconf`
	you will see the WARNING about `ifup -a` disabled because of this. SO JUST DO NOTHING!
